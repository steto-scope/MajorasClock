# MajorasClock

Majora's Clock is a proof-of-concept for an integration of a .NET GUI application onto the Windows Desktop, like Rainlendar/Rainmeter does it as a native C/C++ application. Despite being Beta, the result is still a useable application for setting up quick countdowns with notifications.
